               Hello! My name is Yanik and I enjoy creating things that make a
               difference. My interest in software development started back in
               2015 when I did my first

               at university. I realised how much I enjoyed solving problems
               with computers and it caused me to change majors to mathematics
               and computer science.

               as a software engineer in the graduate program. I'm fortunate to
               join the program as we're able to rotate between different teams
               across the whole bank.

               My main focus these days is to learn as many new technologies as
               I can through real world projects at my work, along with creating
               side projects that inspire me.
